"""A small mod that stands in for textures a game dump holds damaged.

Some dumps of the game carry a few texture files whose first 8 to 12 KB are zeros (the dumper's own checksum matches that
content, so nothing looks wrong: tools/dump_check.py finds them). The game cannot decode such a texture and, when a model
needs it, loads the model again and again for ever, 12 to 22 times a second. That takes more than a processor core for good:
with adult Link, whose fairy fountain model is one of them, it costs frames per second everywhere.

This writes, for each damaged texture it knows, an intact texture of the same family with the same format, size, mip count
and resource-table size (so the memory the game sets aside fits), its name changed in place to the damaged one's. The files go
to <mod folder>/romfs/Tex/, which the game reads instead of its own (see Mods in the README). Your dump is not changed, and
nothing of the game is in this script: the stand-ins are made from your own files.

    python -I tools/dump_repair.py <game folder>/romfs <game folder>/mods/00-dump-repair

Needs the zstandard package (ReLink's own Python has it: tools/python/python.exe in its folder).
Not repaired: Tex/RBake_Scene_GanonStage_G_2_1_d0_t0, a baked atlas whose size no other texture has.
